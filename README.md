# RSA-Encryption
This project simply uses two files in Java to implement the use of RSA 
encryption when sending messages between these two files that act as humans interacting with each other.

## 1. First set up the project as follows: 
Download and install Visual Studio Code
#
Download the zipped folder and unzip it OR clone the repository to your local machine
#
Open the folder from within Visual Studio Code
#
Install "Extension Pack for Java" extension in your Visual Studio Code

## 2. Run the project and start sending messages
Run Alice.java file in one output terminal
#
Run Bob.java file in a different output terminal
#
Send a message from the output terminal of Alice
#
Check Bob's terminal to see the message then send one from his side

## 3. End the system
Type END from Alice's terminal and hit ENTER to end the system
